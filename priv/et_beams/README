This directory contains compiled beam files of the ET application.
If et_beam_path is set on the config file to this dir. then these are going to be loaded on the CADAM node.
In addition to this if network_load is set to true in the config file then the et beam files will be loaded 
from the CADAM node to the target nodes over the network.
This is needed if ET is not available on the target nodes or the Erlang VMs on the target nodes are older 
then the CADAM node's VM (eg. CADAM node runs on R14B03 and is used to monitor a Riak cluster which runs on R13)

Initially this contains beams compiled with 64bit R13B03, but you can replace these or use an other dir. 
and set it in the config).
